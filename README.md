# Seoul Bike Rental Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the demand for bike rentals in Seoul based on various environmental and temporal factors. Using data from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, I explored trends and developed predictive models, with **XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy (R¬≤ = 0.917)**.

The analysis revealed that **temperature, humidity, and precipitation** strongly impact bike demand, while **commuting patterns drive peak usage during morning and evening hours**. Seasonal trends indicate **higher rentals in summer and a decline in winter**, reinforcing the need for dynamic bike redistribution strategies. 

This project demonstrates expertise in **data science, feature engineering, and advanced predictive modeling**, contributing to smarter, data-driven transportation solutions.

## Dataset

- **Source (UCI Machine Learning Repository):** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand
- **Observations:** 8,760 hourly records
- **Features:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall, seasons, holiday indicators, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- The **dataset is complete**, with no missing or duplicate records.
- The distribution of the **response variable is right-skewed**, resembling a Poisson-like pattern.
- **Temperature, humidity, and solar radiation** show strong correlations with bike rental trends, particularly in specific seasons.
- Even **minimal precipitation significantly impacts** bike rental demand.
- **Bike rentals peak** during commuting hours (**7-9 AM & 5-9 PM**), highlighting daily travel patterns.
- **Seasonality is a crucial factor**: Rentals increase in summer and decline in winter.
- **Working and non-working days exhibit distinct rental behaviors**, emphasizing the importance of considering weekday effects.
- **Feature Engineering Enhancements**: Introduced polynomial transformations, interaction terms, and categorical indicators to improve model predictive power.

## Predictive Models
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Linear Regression (No Transformations for Benchmarking)

- **Performance:**
  - RMSE: **355.51**
  - MAE: **230.74**
  - R¬≤: **0.70**
- **Key Issue:** Poor fit due to heteroscedasticity, missing non-linear interactions, polynomial terms, and the absence of key features (categorical factors)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Linear Regression (After Feature Engineering)

- **Performance Improvement:**
  - RMSE: **255.14**
  - MAE: **157.22**
  - R¬≤: **0.845**
- **Key Observation:** Despite significant improvements, **heteroscedasticity remains**, indicating the need for a more advanced model.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost (Best Model)

- **Final Performance:**
  - RMSE: **184.24**
  - MAE: **113.62**
  - R¬≤: **0.917** (Best predictive power!)
- **Key Takeaway:** XGBoost **captured complex relationships effectively** and provided the most stable and accurate predictions.
